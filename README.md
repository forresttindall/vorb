**Vorb** is a lightning-fast, minimalist static site template built with React and Vite, powered by the Bun runtime.

It’s designed for developers who want total control, zero bloat, and immediate performance — without being locked into a rigid, opinionated framework like Next.js.

## Why Vorb?

**Fast by default. Lightweight by design.**  
Vorb gives you everything you need to launch a static site or web app in seconds — and nothing you don’t.

### Key Advantages:

- **No TypeScript**  
  Built for speed and simplicity. Pure JSX/JS.

- **Powered by Bun**  
  Uses Bun for blazing-fast installs, scripts, and development tooling.

- **Vite for Modern DX**  
  Lightning-fast HMR, optimized builds, and native ES module support.

- **Minimal and Flexible**  
  No routing frameworks, no config overhead. Modify or extend however you want.

- **React Without the Bloat**  
  A lean React base without unnecessary wrappers or abstractions.

- **Truly Unopinionated**  
  Vorb doesn’t force you into a specific architecture, folder structure, or dependency chain. Unlike frameworks like Next.js, you're in charge.
